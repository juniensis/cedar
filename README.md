# Cedar
A simple C build system for small projects.

I only really use C for writing small tools or learning about the language.
So, the majority of build systems are too powerful for my use case. Just compiling and
running the binary would likely be just fine, but whats the fun in that?

Cedar can create, compile, and run C projects.
